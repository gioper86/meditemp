# meditemp

Interactive visualization of the sea surface temperature of the Mediterranean sea. It uses [NOAA 
(National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration) High Resolution SST data](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html)

The server side is a simple flask (Python) application and the client side is implemented with AngularJS. 
The plot is a contour chart implemented with Plotly.

In order to start the application just clone the repository and start the webserver by going to the main 
folder and typing `python app.py`

An online demo will soon be available.
